***IMPORTANT NOTE***
Our JAR file, due to unfortunate circumstances, runs, but does
not show any images. However, the game can still be played by looking
at the minimap. You will have better luck running it directly
from an IDE. 
***/IMPORTANT NOTE***

Enclosed in this folder is our project source directory, along
with a JAR file named Iteration_3.jar. 

You may run this programming by running RunGame.java, located in 
src\application\RunGame.java.
